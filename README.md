Enthusiast of the best web development technologies.

Passionate about the web, clean code, good documentation, cloud technologies, and design patterns. I could say I want to change people's lives through programming, but if I am being blunt, most of the time I code because I find it really freaking fun!

"A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it is weightless, and it grows easily under our typing hands. But without care, a program’s size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the person who created it.  When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued—made simple in its complexity."
